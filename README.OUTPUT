    GENERATING DIFFERENT OUTPUT FORMATS

    At present, lsys produces output in one of three formats:
PostScript, a generic text format, and a text format used by the
PHIGS-based software used locally at UNC. The PostScript format is
provided because of the widespread availability of PostScript printers
and previewers; however, it's more suitable for viewing 2D curves and
fractals than 3D plant and tree databases. The generic output format
is a simple an example of how to generate a different format, to be
used as a template for your own format.

    To add a new output format, take the following steps:

    - subclass the pure virtual class DBGenerator to produce a
	database generator (I suggest copying GenericGenerator.[ch] to
	<format>Generator.[ch] and modifying the two new files). Add
	the new <format>Generator.[ch] files to the Makefile.

    - #include the <format>Generator.h header in main.c. Add an
	enumerated type for the new format to the definition of 'enum
	FileType' (ca. line 130), and a new file extension to the
	following string array extension[]. Add a command line option
	(ala -generic) to select this generator, which will set the
	variable 'filetype' to the new enumeration member. In the code
	immediately preceding interpreting the final module list (ca.
	line 387), add a case statement for the new format which
	creates an instance of the new output generator to be passed
	to the interpreter.

    GEOMETRY INFORMATION

    The abstract class DBGenerator provides a framework for your own
format. Many of the methods of the generator are given a reference to
an object of class Turtle, which contains geometric and rendering
information. Methods of class Turtle which may be used by the
generator are:

    BoundingBox bounds()
	Returns the bounding box of all motion taken by the turtle.
	min() and max() methods of class BoundingBox return Vectors of
	the box limits.

    Vector H(), L(), U();
	Returns the heading, left, and up vectors defining the
	orientation of the turtle. The turtle operates in a
	right-handed coordinate system.

    Matrix orientation()
	Returns the orientation as a 3x4 rotation matrix [H L U 0].
	The matrix may be used to rotate externally defined objects
	into the proper frame before rendering them.

    Vector location()
	Returns the Turtle position.

    float  linewidth()
	Returns the current line width.

    int    color()
	Returns the current color index.

    VIEWING TRANSFORMATION

    DBGenerator includes a member of class Camera, initialized at
construction time. This class encapsulates an orthogonal or
perspective transformation, and has three public methods which may be
used to transform geometry for viewing as specified by the user:

    float field_of_view()
	Returns the field of view, in degrees. If this is 0, then an
	orthographic projection is being used. Otherwise, X and Y
	coordinates are scaled by cot(fov/2) / Z (the perspective
	divide).

    Vector transform(const Vector &p)
	Transforms the point p in object space through the viewing
	matrix to device space. If a perspective transformation is
	being used, the perspective divide is done, clipping between
	x,y,z = [-1..1],[-1..1],[0,infinity] should be applied.
	Further, output widths should be scaled by the resulting Z
	depth (this is *not* done by the PostScript driver, and
	perspective output looks terrible as a result).

    Matrix view_matrix()
	Returns the 3x4 translation + rotation matrix used to
	transform points into viewing space before the perspective
	divide.

    Note that if a database is being generated for interactive viewing
on a graphics workstation, the camera transformation should be used
only as a starting point; for final output such as the PostScript
generator produces, the camera transformation should be applied to
points before drawing.

    GENERATOR CLASS METHODS

    Here is a description of the methods you must provide in your
derived <format>Generator class:

    <format>Generator(ofstream *o, Camera &v [optional arguments])
	: DBGenerator(o, v) { your constructor code }

	The constructor for the generator must construct the parent
	class DBGenerator by passing it an output file stream (o) and
	a Camera (class describing viewing parameters). You may add
	class-specific arguments; for example, PSGenerator takes an
	additional boolean flag in its constructor, used to control
	autoscaling of the resulting PostScript.

    void prelude(Turtle &t)

	Called once before graphics output begins; responsible for
	creating any needed header information and then calling
	DBGenerator::prelude(t) to set the initial color and line
	width.

    void postscript(Turtle &t)

	Called once after graphics output ends; responsible for
	creating any needed trailer information and then calling
	DBGenerator::postscript(t) to close the output file.

    void start_graphics(Turtle &t)

	Called before drawing a series of line segments; performs any
	preparation needed to draw lines. For example,
	PSGenerator::start_graphics generates a 'newpath' command. May
	be called multiple times. Guaranteed not to be called twice
	without an intervening flush_graphics() call.

	start_graphics may need to moveto() the current turtle
	location, depending on the output format.

	This is a pure virtual function and must be defined in the
	derived class.

    void flush_graphics(Turtle &t)

	Called after drawing a series of line segments; performs any
	actions needed to render the lines. For example,
	PSGenerator::flush_graphics generates a 'stroke' command. May
	be called multiple times. Guaranteed not to be called twice
	without an intervening start_graphics() call.

	This is a pure virtual function and must be defined in the
	derived class.

    void moveto(Turtle &t)

	Called to move the turtle to a new location without drawing a
	line. This may be called either inside or outside a
	start_graphics() / flush_graphics() pair.

	moveto() should call the parent method DBGenerator::moveto(t)
	as its last action before returning. This method saves the
	current location in the class variable 'currentpos' and sets
	the class variable 'lastmove' to true. Usually, no
	redefinition of moveto() is needed in a derived class.

    void lineto(Turtle &t)

	Called to draw a line (cylinder, branch, etc.) to a new
	location. This is guaranteed to be called only within a
	start_graphics() / flush-graphics() pair. If the class invoked
	DBGenerator::moveto(), the starting point of the line will be
	in the class variable 'currentpos', and the class variable
	'lastmove' will be true iff the last move/draw was a move. The
	end point of the line may be obtained from the turtle method
	t.location().

	lineto() should call the parent method DBGenerator::lineto(t)
	as its last action before returning. This method saves the
	current location in 'currentpos' and sets 'lastmove' to false.

    void polygon(Turtle &t, Polygon &p)

	Called to generate a polygon. Polygon is a list of the polygon
	vertices as defined by the L-system (see
	GenericGenerator::polygon for an example of accessing the
	vertices). This is guaranteed to be called *outside* a
	start_graphics() / flush_graphics() pair. It may call these
	routines as needed, but must to return with graphics flushed.

	This is a pure virtual function and must be defined in the
	derived class.

    void flower(Turtle &t, float radius)
    void leaf(Turtle &t, float length)
    void apex(Turtle &t, Vector &start, float length)

	These functions generate simple previewing approximations of
	flower, leaf, and flowering apex structures respectively. They
	are guaranteed to be called *outside* a start_graphics() /
	flush-graphics() pair and return with graphics flushed.

	The structures should be placed at the current location with
	the current orientation and be of the specified size (radius /
	length respectively). The PostScript generator draws filled
	circles, filled arcs, and polygons for these objects.

	These are pure virtual functions and must be defined in the
	derived class.

    void draw_object(Turtle &t, Module &m)

	This is responsible for including the externally defined
	object referred to by the bound (all parameters numeric)
	module m. It is guaranteed to be called only *outside* a
	start_graphics() / flush-graphics() pair and return with
	graphics flushed.

	The object should be placed at the current location with the
	current orientation, and parameter information may be used for
	any purpose (such as scaling, texture assignment, selection of
	different versions of the object, etc.)

	Since there is no defined format for external objects at
	present, this routine is not defined to do anything in the
	PostScript generator.

	This is a pure virtual function and must be defined in the
	derived class.

    void set_color(Turtle &t)
    void set_width(Turtle &t)

	These functions set the current color and width respectively.
	They are guaranteed to be called only *outside* a
	start_graphics() / flush-graphics() pair and must return with
	graphics flushed.

	The interpretation of the output color (an integer) is
	class-dependent; the PostScript generator uses it to select
	gray levels, but other generators might want to use it as an
	index into a color map or as a texture index. This has
	unfortunate implications for portability of L-systems between
	different output formats, and some work on the color model is
	needed.

	The line width should be used as the diameter of the
	twig/stalk/branchlike structures generated by
	moveto()/lineto().

	These are pure virtual functions and must be defined in the
	derived class.

    DATABASE NAME

    The member "object_name" is a string describing the name of the
object to be generated. This is ignored by most types of output
generators, but is useful for some types of display-list oriented code
(PHIGS) which want to identify each component of the structure. Unless
otherwise specified, the object name is taken to be the basename of
the output file name.

    The name may be set by the method DBGenerator::set_name(char
*name). It should be set before calling the prelude() method.
